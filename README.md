# Very Racing Game - Setup Guide

Check full game documentation IN GAME_DOCUMENTATION.md

## Quick Start

This guide will help you get the Very Racing Game running locally in under 10 minutes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- **MetaMask** browser extension - [Install here](https://metamask.io/) or Rabby wallet, personally I prefer rabby due to smooth user experience and bug free.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd my-very-game
```

Set up .env file with private key (optional for contract redeploment)

```bash
# WalletConnect Project ID

VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID="WalletConnect Project ID"

# Network Configuration

VITE_VERY_RPC_URL=https://rpc.verylabs.io
VITE_VERY_CHAIN_ID=4613

# Contract Addresses - Update these after deployment

VITE_RACING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="new racing contract address"
VITE_RACING_TOKEN_ADDRESS="new token contract address"
VITE_TOURNAMENTS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="new tournament contract address"
PRIVATE_KEY="your evm wallet private key without 0x prefix"
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including React, Vite, Hardhat, and Web3 libraries.

### Step 3: Configure Network

Add the Very Network to your MetaMask:

**Network Details:**

- Network Name: `Very Network`
- RPC URL: `https://rpc.verylabs.io`
- Chain ID: `4613`
- Currency Symbol: `VERY`
- Block Explorer URL: `https://www.veryscan.io`

### Step 4: Get VERY Tokens

1. Visit the Very Network faucet (if available) or acquire VERY tokens
2. You'll need these tokens to interact with the game contracts
3. VERY tokens are used for minting NFTs and transaction fees

### Step 5: Deploy Contracts (Optional)

If you want to deploy fresh contracts:

```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to Very Network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-contracts.js --network veryNetwork
```

**Note:** The game is already configured with pre-deployed contracts, so this step is optional. The script automatically updates the .env file with new contracts.

### Step 6: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:5173` or any available port as at the time of deployment.

### Step 7: Connect Your Wallet

1. Open the game in your browser
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Approve the MetaMask connection
4. It automatically connect to very if you have it added in your wallet, if not, it will request approval to add the network.

### Step 8: Start Playing

1. **Mint your first car** - Click "mint starter racer on the welcome page" to purchase a starter car (0.01 XTZ)
2. **Enter a race** - Go to "Main Menu" and click "Start Race"
3. **Earn rewards** - Complete races to earn FAST tokens and XP
4. **Check leaderboard** - View your stats and compete with others

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Wrong Network" Error:**

- Switch to Very Network in MetaMask or Rabby wallet.
- Refresh the page

**Transaction Fails:**

- Ensure you have enough VERY for gas fees
- Try increasing gas limit in MetaMask

**Game Won't Load:**

- Clear browser cache
- Disable ad blockers
- Try a different browser

**Can't Connect Wallet:**

- Update MetaMask to latest version or use rabby wallet preferrably
- Check if MetaMask is unlocked
- Try refreshing the page

### Network Configuration Issues

If you can't connect to Very Network:

1. Manually add the network in MetaMask:

   - Settings ‚Üí Networks ‚Üí Add Network
   - Use the network details from Step 3

2. Import the network configuration:
   ```javascript
   {
     "chainId": "4613",
     "chainName": "Very Network",
     "rpcUrls": ["https://rpc.verylabs.io"],
     "nativeCurrency": {
       "name": "VERY",
       "symbol": "VERY",
       "decimals": 18
     }
   }
   ```

## Advanced Setup

# Run contract tests
npx hardhat test

# Run with coverage
npx hardhat coverage
```

### Building for Production

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify network configuration in MetaMask
3. Ensure you have sufficient test XTZ tokens
4. Try clearing browser cache and hard refresh
